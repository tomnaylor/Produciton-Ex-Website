## Design

### Original sketch
I drew an outline sketch with first to get a basic feel of a design. 

### Wireframes
After the initial sketch, I then moved to Balsamic and created a wireframe for each page over the three responsive sizes (desktop, tablet and mobile). You can view the PDF wireframes by clicking on the below:

### Fonts
To provide a reliable and fast font library, I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"), picking two complimentary fonts.

For headings and words I want to stand out I've used the [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text=ProductionEx&preview.text_type=custom "Google fonts: Lato") font. 

For the remaining text I chose the [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?preview.text=ProductionEx&preview.text_type=custom "Google fonts: Raleway") font.

### Icons
To add a more familiar feel to the website, I have added icons to sit alongside (and sometimes instead of) text links and buttons. I choose the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome").
