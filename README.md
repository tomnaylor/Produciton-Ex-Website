Welcome to ProductionEx, a production software package for Festivals, Theatres and other complex events. We are a leading standard in managing production information for a range of events, from Glastonbury festival to the stage production of mirror cracked. We collate, validate and deliver timely information, and automate many tasks backstage production tasks.  

For my MS1, I wanted to create a front-end sales website for a web app I designed for a festival my work host bi-annually.

## Design

### Original sketch
I drew an outline sketch first to get a basic feel of a design. 
![Concepts sketch](assets/readme/concepts-sketch.jpg)


### Wireframes
After the initial sketch, I then moved to Balsamic and created a wireframe for the three responsive sizes (desktop, tablet and mobile). You can [view the PDF wireframe here](assets/readme/wireframe-index.pdf)

### Fonts
To provide a reliable and fast font library, I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts"), picking two complimentary fonts.

For headings and words I want to stand out I've used the [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?preview.text=ProductionEx&preview.text_type=custom "Google fonts: Lato") font. 

For the remaining text I chose the [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?preview.text=ProductionEx&preview.text_type=custom "Google fonts: Raleway") font.

### Icons
To add a more familiar feel to the website, I have added icons to sit alongside (and sometimes instead of) text links and buttons. I choose the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). 

### Colours

### Hero image
I used the website **unsplash** to find an image that would work as the hero background.

## Testing

### Discovered Bugs

#### Solved

* **Sign up button**
  * Sign-up button would move below hero image and disapeer behind the main section in mobile devices.
  * To fix the issue I changed the position to use bottom and not top to ensure that whatever the height of the hero image, the CTA stayed 100px from the bottom.

* **Hover client logo**
  * The popup description would open and close quickly as the mouse moved over the client logo container.
  * Changed onmouseover to two seperate calls to mouseenter and mouseleave so the javascript function wasn't trigged on every mouse move.

* **Multiple client logos**
  * The popup description would only open on the first container.
  * With help from [Mamun](https://stackoverflow.com/users/7461381/mamun) in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50793136/javascript-click-function-only-works-on-first-element) I altered the javascript to loop thru each matching query.


* **Main nav items**
  * When the screen size reduced to circa. 750px, the top navigation links crashed into each other
  * In the tablet only CSS I removed the centre logo to give the menu items more space

* **Mobile home link**
  * When in mobile view the home logo is removed for space. This was the  link back to the top of the index page. This stopped the user from being able to navigate easily.
  * I added a mobile only home link at the top of the navigation ul list.

* **Videos slowed page loads**
  * Adding the video guides reduced the lighthouse score as each video (x3) preloaded.
  * I added the preload="none" to each video and then to make them visually appealing, I added a poster image to show before playing the media.

* **Sign-up modal**
  * On mobile devices with small height screens the fixed position modal wasn't able to be scrolled. This ment that most of the form inputs were not accessable
  * Changed the height to 100% and removed the bottom and right css entries to allow the box to expand to show all the contents.

* **Transitions**
  * All transitions happened on page load (which started from the non styled state)
  * This seems to be a bug with the chrome browser. I used advice on [this page](https://github.com/LeaVerou/prefixfree/issues/99) and added an empty script tag at the bottom of the body. This seems to have stopped the issue for me.
